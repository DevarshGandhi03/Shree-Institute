              Shreee Institute was established from the home of Kamini maam as
              she was passionate about teaching. From humble beginning of 2 kids
              within few years she graduated to taking a batch of 5. From there
              withing a decade we reached to class of 20 and today we are proud
              to teach a large number of students of Gujarat Board from well
              over 15 different schools in our area.
            </p>
            <p  data-aos="fade-left" style="overflow: hidden;" >
              We started with only SS English and started the Maths Science
              chapter when Kushan Sir joined the institute 8 years ago. He was
              able to use his international exposure to bring in projectors and
              smart boards and eventually the app which has well over 2000 self
              made videos which helps hundreds of students to improve their
              result.
            </p>
            <p  data-aos="fade-right" style="overflow: hidden;">We belive in three things when we teach.</p>
            <p  data-aos="fade-left" style="overflow: hidden;">
              <b>EDUCATE</b> - Teaching textbook knowledge is not sufficient. we try to
              educate our children as to why those textbooks were written, how
              to apply good things from tetxtbook to our life and how to
              practically imbibe the academic learning to real life.
            </p>
            <p  data-aos="fade-right" style="overflow: hidden;">
             <b> ENGAGE </b>- Teaching is interesting and fun for us, but ask a student
              and he/she would say that studies are a burden. To change the
              mindset of students we aim to engage them into fun activities,
              games, quizes and try to provide a more wider approach to study
              then just textbook learning.
            </p>
